instantSHOUT is a web application which enable you to chat simultaneously with many users (all of the same group).

Here you can invite your friends, create a password protected group to make a closed chat room.

Switching between groups is fun with a one line command to be writtn in your favourite IM client like Gtalk.

The web interface is needed only to invite friends, create groups and view available groups and their status.

The application is live on App Engine at https://instantshout.appspot.com . Python being my favourite has been used as the runtime language.
